# Marble Game Upgrade
This is an upgrade to the Marble Game which is originally designed by Mike Hergaarden from M2H for Unity game tutorials. I have upgraded the game for BBM423 Game Technologies Laboratory course at Hacettepe University.

Marble Game is a balancing game where you guide a rolling 'ball' through a level while collecting items. This is a 3D game which has a game manager that keeps track of game states (Playing, Won, Lost).
