# MARBLE GAME UPGRADE
This is an upgrade to the Marble Game which is originally designed by Mike Hergaarden from M2H for Unity game tutorials. I have upgraded the game for BBM423 Game Technologies Laboratory course at Hacettepe University.

Marble Game is a balancing game where you guide a rolling 'ball' through a level while collecting items. This is a 3D game which has a game manager that keeps track of game states (Playing, Won, Lost).

# Initial Design vs Updated Design

# Game Objects

These objects are collectibles which increments the user game score. Objects are placed along the level and it is necessary to collect each of them to win the game. Also animation script is attached to these collectibles and objects regularly rotates, scales, floats.

Key object is also a collectible and affects the score, but additional to previous game objects it has extra impact for gameplay. When player gets the key, new level becomes active. The level will be invisible until user gets the key.
